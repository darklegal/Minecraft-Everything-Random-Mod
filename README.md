# Goal

The goal of the Everything Random mod is to add various random things to Minecraft. The mod does not have one set theme or anything like that besides stuff that might be cool to have.


# Things planned to be added
###### When they are added, there will be a check in the box

- [x] Daymetal and Nightmetal ingots and blocks
- [x] Randominium ore, bits, nuggets, ingots and blocks
- [x] Sharpened Swords

**More to come!**


# Things that might be added, maybe not
###### If they are added, there will be a check in the box

- [ ] Item Conveyor Belts
- [ ] Item Elevators
- [ ] Power Crystals

# Things that were not planned but added anyways
###### When something shows up here, there's a 100% chance it was added, else it wouldnt be listed here at all

**Nothing Here Yet!**
