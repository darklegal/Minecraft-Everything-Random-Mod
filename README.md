# Goal

The goal of the Everything Random mod is to add various random things to Minecraft. The mod does not have one set theme or anything like that besides stuff that might be cool to have.


### Things planned to be added

- [ ] Lightmetal, Darkmetal, Daymetal and Nightmetal ingots and blocks
- [ ] Randominium ore, bits, nuggets, ingots and blocks
- [ ] Grindstone to use the Randominium
- [ ] Dyed Quartz Blocks, Pillars and Chiseled Blocks, Concrete is very saturated and wool is in the middle, dyed quartz is the pastel
- [ ] Nether Reactor from the early days of Minecraft PE
- [ ] Void Bin that you can use to delete items
- [ ] Icy Cobblestone
- [ ] Abandoned Castles in the tundras and plains

### Things that were not planned but added anyways

**Nothing Here Yet!**
