# Goal

The goal of the Everything Random mod is to add various random things to Minecraft. The mod does not have one set theme or anything like that besides stuff that might be cool to have.


# Things planned to be added
###### When they are added, there will be a check in the box

- [x] Daymetal and Nightmetal ingots and blocks
- [x] Randominium ore, bits, nuggets, ingots and blocks
- [x] Sharpened Swords

**More to come!**


# Things that might be added, maybe not
###### If they are added, there will be a check in the box

- [ ] Item Conveyor Belts
- [ ] Item Elevators
- [ ] Power Crystals

# Things that were not planned but added anyways
###### When something shows up here, there's a 100% chance it was added, else it wouldnt be listed here at all

**Nothing Here Yet!**


# Modpack information

###### I am alright with all modpacks, as long as the following conditions are met

- The modpack is not intended to be slanderous or mean-spirited (for example, including it in a pack called `sh***y mods by sh***y modders` or the like
- The modpack links back to here or the curseforge page for the mod as credit, along with my name

#### Very simple guidelines


# Important information about any assets in the mod
###### I'm being 100% serious in this section.

#### I am not alright with **ANYONE** taking and using **ANY** portions of code or assets (including textures and models) and using them if they fall under the following condition(s)

- Adding the code to their own mod
- Using the textures or models in their own mod
- Using assets in artwork or the like without proper credit


#### I *am* alright with someone using my models and/or textures if it falls under the following condition(s)

- Using assets in artwork or the like with proper and clearly visible credit
- Using it in a resource pack for the mod ONLY


If you're unsure of what your usage falls under, ask me



# Agreement
###### By downloading and/or using this mod you agree to the following

- You will follow the guidelines in the previous/above category
- I am not responsible for any sort of damage or data loss that the mod may cause, even though there is no reason for it to do either

Not much to it
